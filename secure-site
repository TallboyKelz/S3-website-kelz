Secure the website using CloudFront

Objective:
The idea is to use SSL/TLS Termination. Clients will connect to Cloudfront using HTTPS (secure connection) and connect to our website endpoint using HTTP.

Prerequisites:
Your static website files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) must already be uploaded to an S3 bucket.
You should have an SSL/TLS certificate ready in AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) for your custom domain, if using one but since geting a custom domain costs money and we are using the free tier, we will use the endpoint of our s3 bucket instead of registering a custom domain on Route 53.

Create a CloudFront Distribution
Open the CloudFront Console:

Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the CloudFront service.
Create a Distribution:

Click on "Create Distribution".
Choose "Web" as the delivery method (it's the default).
Click "Get Started".

Configure the Distribution:

Origin Settings:

Origin Domain Name: Select your S3 bucket from the dropdown list ().


Viewer Protocol Policy: Select "Redirect HTTP to HTTPS" to enforce HTTPS.

Allowed HTTP Methods: Choose "GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, POST, PATCH, DELETE" to allow necessary HTTP methods.

Distribution Settings:

Alternate Domain Names (CNAMEs): Enter your custom domain name - We wont use this

SSL Certificate: We wont use this.

Create the Distribution:

Click "Create Distribution" at the bottom of the page.


Step 3: Testing and Validation
Wait for Deployment:

It may take some time (typically up to 15-30 minutes) for CloudFront to deploy globally.
Testing:

Access your website using the CloudFront domain name 

Ensure your website loads correctly over HTTPS.

Test different pages and functionality to confirm everything works as expected.

Step 4: Additional Security Considerations
Origin Access Identity (OAI):

Optionally, configure an OAI to restrict access to your S3 bucket directly and only allow access through CloudFront.

Security Headers:

Consider adding security headers (e.g., Content Security Policy, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.) to enhance security.
Monitoring and Logging:

Enable CloudFront access logs and monitor for any security-related events or anomalies.
