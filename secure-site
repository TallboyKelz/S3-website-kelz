SECURING THE SITE USING CLOUDFRONT

OBJECTIVE
The idea is to use SSL/TLS termination to secure the website. Clients will connect to Cloudfront using HTTPS (a secure connection) whilst CloudFront connects to our website environment using HTTP.

PREREQUISITE
We already have a website being hosted in a S3 bucket.
Ideally, you should have an SSL/TLS certificate ready in AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) for your custom domain, but getting a custom domain costs money and since we are using the free tier, we will use the endpoint of our s3 bucket instead of registering a custom domain on Route 53.

CREATE THE CLOUDFRONT DISTRIBUTION
* Open the CloudFront Console,go to the AWS Management Console, and navigate to the CloudFront service. 
* Click on "Create Distribution".
* Choose "Web" as the delivery method (it's the default).
* Click "Get Started".

CONFIGURE THE DISTRIBUTION
* Origin Domain Name: Select your S3 bucket from the dropdown list (http://kelz-static-website-hosting-s3.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com).

* Viewer Protocol Policy: Select "Redirect HTTP to HTTPS" to enforce HTTPS. This make the connection secure.

* Allowed HTTP Methods: Choose "GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, POST, PATCH, DELETE" to allow necessary HTTP methods.

DISTRIBUTION SETTINGS:

* Alternate Domain Names (CNAMEs): Enter your custom domain name - We wont use this since we did not register a custom domain name for the website.

* SSL Certificate: We won't use this since we do not have a custom domain name for our website.

* Create the Distribution:

Click "Create Distribution" at the bottom of the page.


TESTING AND VALIDATION
* Wait for CloudFront to deploy.
It may take some time (typically up to 15-30 minutes) for CloudFront to deploy globally.

* Access your website using the CloudFront domain name and ensure the website loads correctly over HTTPS.

* Test different pages and functionality to confirm everything is working as expected.
